### This repositories purposes

* My **assignments** for the course will be hosted in this repository for viewing.
* I will have the opportunity to play around with github for the first time and familiarize myself with the platform.
* The repository will be treated as a hub that shows my progress in learning ***R and markdown concepts*** over the span of the course
